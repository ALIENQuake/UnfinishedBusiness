*** This file is only intended for use for Baldur's Gate II with the Throne Of Bhaal expansion installed. It should not cause any conflicts or problems without it, but this cannot be guaranteed.

The file AR4500.BCS contained in this archive is a modified version of the Baldur's Gate II: Throne Of Bhaal area control script for the Pocket Plane.

It has been provided by BioWare Senior Designer David Gaider as a supplement to Throne Of Bhaal. It causes the player to gain Bhaalpowers that were originally planed for the game but removed.

In David Gaider's words: "We originally had planned out some Bhaalspawn powers that the player would accumulate after doing the challenges in the pocket plane.  It was scrapped because it was thought that these extra abilities plus all the high-level abilities would get too confusing.  All of the abilities are still in the game, though, so it was minor scripting to add them back in for those people who would like to try them."

To use:

Simply unzip the file AR4500.BCS into the Override folder inside your Baldur's Gate II folder, and quit/restart Baldur's Gate II: Throne Of Bhaal (if it's already running.)

Update of 2001 - Sept. 16

Addendum: Descriptions Of The High-Level Abilities

Note that the abilities received are determined by the responses to the Solar before completing the challenges. There are four "good" and four "evil" sets of responses and thus abilities.
-------------------------
(Good Ability for Challenge #1)
Mass Healing (Necromancy)
Range: Sight of caster 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30 foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

When using this ability, the Bhaalspawn must picture the faces of his fellow party members clearly and focus on the unity of the group.  Upon completion, all party members within 30 foot radius of the caster are healed 2d8 + 2/level hit points.  Other conditions suffered by the party are cured, as well: fatigue, poison, disease, blindness and deafness.
-------------------------
(Evil Ability for Challenge #1)
Regeneration (Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Sphere:  Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

This powerful spell enables the priest to imbue 1 creature with the ability to regenerate.  This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs.  The creature affected will regain 3 hit points per second.  The effect lasts for 1 round per every 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled.  For example, a 14th level priest would regenerate 18 hit points per round for 7 rounds.
-------------------------
(Good Ability for Challenge #2)
Draw Upon Holy Might (Invocation) 
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

The Bhaalspawn calls upon the might of his blood to grant him power for a short period.  When he does this, his strength, constitution and dexterity all are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster.  A third level caster would have his abilities raised by 1, while a 12th level caster would have all his abilities raised by 4.
-------------------------
(Evil Ability for Challenge #2)
Dark Taint (Necromancy) 
Range: 20 feet
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Through this spell, the Bhaalspawn can expel the taint of their evil sire onto a victim, poisoning those who fail their save vs. death.  The effects depend upon the caster's level and are detailed below:
7-9th level:  2d8  +  2/round, slow for 12 seconds, save at -2
10-12th level:  3d8  + 3/round, slow for 12 seconds, save at -2
13-14th level:  4d8  +  4/round, slow for 12 seconds, save at -2
15-16th level:  6d8  +  5/round, slow for 24 seconds, save at -2
17-21st level:  8d8  +  6/round, slow for 24 seconds, save at -4

-------------------------
(Evil Ability for Challenge #3)
Hand of Murder (Necromancy) 
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 rounds/5 levels
Casting Time: 1
Saving Throw: none 

When this power is called upon by the Bhaalspawn, they immediately do extra damage with each hit to their target with any melee weapon they wish (whether it be fist or sword), their dark energies travelling through their weapon and assaulting their victim...and absorb that damage as healing to themselves.
The effects vary by level as follows:
10th: 2 rounds, 4 hp extra damage, 4 hp healed
15th: 3 rounds, 6 hp extra damage, 6 hp healed
20th: 4 rounds, 8 hp extra damage, 8 hp healed
25th: 5 rounds, 10 hp extra damage, 10 hp healed
30th: 6 rounds, 12 hp extra damage, 12 hp healed
-------------------------
(Good Ability for Challenge #4)
Resurrection (Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature Touched
Saving Throw: None

Like the 5th level spell Raise Dead, Resurrection will return a character back to life.  However, Resurrection also heals the character so that they are ready for the adventuring life once more.
-------------------------
(Evil Ability for Challenge #4)
Permanent 25% Resistance to Physical Damage (Slashing/Piercing/Crushing/Missile)

(no description required)
